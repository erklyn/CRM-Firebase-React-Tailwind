Trying to develop a CRM APP for the Company I am Working for.

Whole materialUi and Tailwind didn't really make things easy while using formik so i ditched the idea. Just going to use Firebase and React without tailwind.

Other Project will be in my repos.

If works normally I will release everyone to use and will be free beside the cost of firebase and hosting.

What is CRM (Customer Relationship Management)?  I am not a sales guy so I am going to tell you basicly what it is. It is for you to see what Your Sales team doing who they are talking to and what they offer and such information from just one platform. Basicly a CRUD application with attitude. They charge a lot in my opinion. 
Most Charge a lot because they integrated everything into it. They make apps , websites, mailing , hosting etc. 

My solution would be good for 2 reasons I don't really care about money so it's free. Atleast on the software side. This is a web application but I will integrate a iOS app in the near future and a android app with Flutter. I am a mobile developer this is just a project for me.


My Solution's costs - Well it's really about how much you use. First of all you need to host your own app in the web. And because i am using Firestore as a backend. You need to open a firebase account and if you go up from the threshold you have to pay. if scaling isn't a issue for you this shouldn't be a problem imo.

Hope you have a great day
